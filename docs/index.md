## Introduction

This site is a revamped version of my orignal documentation site for my home Kubernetes cluster. My cluster has evolved significantly since I first set up the original documentation, and I wanted to create a new site that better reflects the current state of my cluster and provides a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience for readers.

## Architecture

The new documentation site is built using [Zensical](https://zensical.dev/), a modern static site generator that allows for easy content creation and management. This is then published to a Cloudlfare Worker with their automated GitHub integration for seamless deployment.

## Roadmap

Eventually, I plan to use this site to document the cluster in detail to aid maintenance and future development and maybe in the vague hope it is useful to others.
